## Overview
The nonprofit foundation Alphabet Soup wants a tool that can help it select the applicants for funding with the best chance of success in their ventures. The dataset is a CSV which contains more than 34,000 organizations that have received funding from Alphabet Soup over the years. Within this dataset are a number of columns that capture metadata about each organization. Using this data, we have created machine learning models to create a binary classifier that can predict whether applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup.
